``torch.compile`` Troubleshooting
=================================

So you're trying to slap ``torch.compile`` on your PyTorch model in hopes of getting it to run faster.
But it's not working as expected - perhaps performance isn't improving, you're experiencing a crash,
or compilation time is too long. This article details some tips, workarounds, and debugging tools
that you can use to unblock yourself.

Setting Expectations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``torch.compile`` is intended to be a general-purpose PyTorch compiler.
Compared to the previous compiler solution (TorchScript), ``torch.compile``
requires fewer code changes (we generally do not require models to be re-written from the ground up)
and handles unsupported code better (generally results in a lost optimization opportunity, rather than a crash).

In the ideal world, one should just be able to slap ``torch.compile`` to any PyTorch model and get free speedups.
Unfortunately, the real world is full of rogue code, so in practice, we end up in one of 3 situations:

1. ``torch.compile`` just works, and you get speedups!
2. Some modifications to your code are necessary. ``torch.compile`` doesn't crash/take a long time,
   but you might not be seeing significant performance gains.
3. A lot of changes are required to your code.

We expect most code to fall under situations (1) and (2).
This document provides tips, listed in increasing involvement, for how to deal with code in situation (2).

Compile times
-------------

``torch.compile`` is implemented as a just-in-time compiler, so the first few (1 or 2) runs
of the compiled function are expected to be significantly slower. Recompilations (details below on when this may happen)
will also make runs slower. Various ``torch.compile`` components cache results in order to
reduce compilation time for future invocations, even in different processes.
Cold-start (uncached) compilation time is expected to be on the order of seconds to minutes for common/benchmarked models.
Larger models may take upwards of 30 minutes to a few hours.

Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following terms are relevant to troubleshooting ``torch.compile`` problems.

Graph break
-----------

``torch.compile`` traces through your code and attempts to capture your PyTorch code into a
single computation graph of PyTorch operators (FX graph). This is not always possible to do -
when we encounter code that we can't trace through, we perform a "graph break."
A graph break involves compiling the FX graph we have determined so far, running the unsupported code,
then resuming tracing after the unsupported code with a new FX graph.
Because the computation graph is broken up, we lose optimization opportunities,
so model code should avoid graph breaks whenever possible.
We graph break on things like

- data-dependent if-statements
- many Python builtin functions, and
- C functions.

Below is an example of a graph break due to the function ``copy.deepcopy`` from a Python builtin library
(exact output may differ).

.. code-block:: py

    import copy
    import torch

    @torch.compile
    def fn(x):
        x = x + 1
        y = copy.deepcopy(x)
        return y + 1

    fn(torch.ones(3, 3))

        raise Unsupported(msg, case_name=case_name)
    torch._dynamo.exc.Unsupported: copy.deepcopy TensorVariable()

Guards
------

``torch.compile`` makes some assumptions about runtime values as we trace through code.
During tracing, we generate "guards", which are runtime checks for these assumptions.
Guards are run in future calls to the compiled function to determine if we can reuse previously compiled code.
Examples of runtime checks are constant values, types, and object IDs.

Below is an example of generated guards. The ``TENSOR_MATCH`` guard checks for the input's type, device, dtype, shape, etc.

.. code-block:: py

    import torch

    @torch.compile
    def fn(x):
        return x + 1

    fn(torch.ones(3, 3))

::

    $ TORCH_LOGS="guards" python playground.py
    GUARDS:

    TREE_GUARD_MANAGER:
    +- RootGuardManager
    | +- DEFAULT_DEVICE: utils_device.CURRENT_DEVICE == None                           # _dynamo/output_graph.py:471 in init_ambient_guards
    | +- GLOBAL_STATE: ___check_global_state()
    | +- TORCH_FUNCTION_MODE_STACK: ___check_torch_function_mode_stack()
    | +- GuardManager: source=L['x'], accessed_by=DictGetItemGuardAccessor(x)
    | | +- TENSOR_MATCH: check_tensor(L['x'], Tensor, DispatchKeySet(CPU, BackendSelect, ADInplaceOrView, AutogradCPU), torch.float32, device=None, requires_grad=False, size=[3, 3], stride=[3, 1])  # return x + 1  # playground.py:6 in fn
    | | +- NO_HASATTR: hasattr(L['x'], '_dynamo_dynamic_indices') == False           # return x + 1  # playground.py:6 in fn

Recompilation
-------------

If we fail the guards for every instance of previously compiled code,
then ``torch.compile`` must "recompile" the function - the original code needs to be traced again.

Below, we need to recompile since the guard checking for the tensor argument's shape failed.

.. code-block:: py

    import torch

    @torch.compile
    def fn(x):
        return x + 1

    fn(torch.ones(3, 3))
    fn(torch.ones(4, 4))

::

    $ TORCH_LOGS="recompiles" python playground.py
    Recompiling function fn in /data/users/williamwen/pytorch/playground.py:3
        triggered by the following guard failure(s):
        - 0/0: tensor 'L['x']' size mismatch at index 0. expected 3, actual 4

Dynamic Shapes
``torch.compile`` by first assumes tensor shapes are static/constant and thus guard on these.
By using "dynamic shapes,"" we can get ``torch.compile`` to produce compiled code that can accept
tensor inputs with different shapes - we avoid recompiling every time shapes differ.
By default, automatic dynamic shapes are enabled ``torch.compile(dynamic=None)`` -
if compilation fails due to shape mismatch, recompilation is attempted with dynamic shapes.
Dynamic shapes can also be fully enabled ``dynamic=True`` or disabled ``dynamic=False``.

Below, we enable dynamic shapes and note that we no longer need to recompile.

.. code-block:: py

    import torch

    @torch.compile(dynamic=True)
    def fn(x):
        return x + 1

    fn(torch.ones(3, 3))
    fn(torch.ones(4, 4))

::

    $ TORCH_LOGS="dynamic,recompiles" python playground.py
    create_symbol s0 = 3 for L['x'].size()[0] [2, int_oo] at playground.py:5 in fn (_dynamo/variables/builder.py:2718 in <lambda>), for more info run with TORCHDYNAMO_EXTENDED_DEBUG_CREATE_SYMBOL="s0"
    produce_guards
    produce_guards

For more information on dynamic shapes, see `The dynamic shapes manual <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GgvOe7C8_NVOMLOCwDaYV1mXXyHMXY7ExoewHqooxrs/edit#heading=h.fh8zzonyw8ng>`__

Logging Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``tlparse`` / ``TORCH_TRACE``
-----------------------------

``tlparse`` / ``TORCH_TRACE`` are a pair of tools that produce compilation reports that look like this:
https://web.mit.edu/~ezyang/Public/bhack-20240609-tlparse/index.html.

Traces are very easy to collect. To collect a trace, run your reproduction command with

::

    TORCH_TRACE="/tmp/tracedir" python foo.py
    pip install tlparse
    tlparse /tmp/tracedir

This will work even if you are running a distributed job (you will get a trace per rank).
This will open up your browser with HTML like generated above.
If you are making a bug report for a complicated problem that you don't have a standalone reproduction for,
you can still greatly assist PyTorch developers by attaching the trace log generated in ``/tmp/tracedir``.

.. warning:: The trace log contains all of your model code.
   Do not share the trace log if the model you are working on is sensitive. The trace log does NOT contain weights.

The output of ``tlparse`` is mostly oriented at PyTorch developers,
and the log format is very easy to upload and share on GitHub.
However, you can still get some useful information from it as a non-PyTorch developer.
First, we recommend reading the help text that is inline in the report: it helps explain what the report means.
Here are some things you can get from a ``tlparse``:

- What model code was compiled, by looking at the stack trie?
  (This is especially useful if you're not familiar with the codebase being compiled!)
- How many graph breaks / distinct compilation regions are there?
  (Each distinct compile is its own color coded block like <span style="background-color: #027f02;">[0/0]</span>).
  Frames that are potentially graph break'ed are light green  <span style="background-color: #00ff00;">[2/4]</span>.
  If there are a lot of frames, that is suspicious, and suggests that you had some catastrophic graph breaks,
  or maybe your code isn't a good match for ``torch.compile``.
- How many times did I recompile a particular frame? Something that recompiled a lot will look like:
  <span style="background-color: #027f02;">[10/0]</span>
  <span style="background-color: #027f02;">[10/1]</span>
  <span style="background-color: #027f02;">[10/2]</span>
  - if something is being recompiled a lot, that is very suspicious and worth looking into, even if it isn't the root cause of your problem.
- Was there a compilation error?  Frames that errored will look like <span style="background-color: #ff0000;">[0/1]</span>.
- What intermediate compiler products did I generate for a given frame?
  For example, you can look at the high-level generated FX graph or the generated Triton code.
- Is there relevant information for a particular frame? You can find these in compilation_metrics.

``TORCH_LOGS``
--------------

You can use the ``TORCH_LOGS`` environment variable to selectively enable parts of the ``torch.compile`` stack to log.
``TORCH_LOGS`` is in fact the source of logs for ``tlparse``. The format of the ``TORCH_LOGS`` envvar is

::

    TORCH_LOGS="<option1>,<option2>,..." python foo.py


Useful high-level options are:

- ``graph_breaks``: logs locations of graph breaks in user code and the reason for the graph break
- ``guards``: logs guards that are generated
- ``recompiles``: logs which function recompiled and the guards that failed, leading to the recompilation
- ``dynamic``: logs related to dynamic shapes

You can also programatically set logging options using ``torch._logging.set_logs``:

.. code-block:: py

    import logging
    torch._logging.set_logs(graph_breaks=True)
    ...

More ``TORCH_LOGS`` options are detailed below (TODO link).
For the full list of options, see https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/logging.html
and https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch._logging.set_logs.html#torch._logging.set_logs.

``tlparse`` is ideal for debugging large models and gaining a high-level overview of how your model was compiled,
while ``TORCH_LOGS`` is preferred for small examples and fine-grained debugging detail,
when we already have an idea of which ``torch.compile`` component is causing the problem.

Simple Workarounds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where to apply ``torch.compile``?
---------------------------------

We recommend applying ``torch.compile`` to the highest-level function that doesn't cause excessive problems.
Typically, this will be your train/eval step (with the optimizer, but without the loop), your top-level ``nn.Module``,
or some sub-``nn.Module``s. ``torch.compile`` specifically doesn't handle distributed wrapper modules like
DDP or FSDP very well, so consider applying ``torch.compile`` to the inner module passed to the wrapper.

.. code-block:: py

    # inference
    model = ...
    opt_model = torch.compile(model)

    for _ in range(N_ITERS):
        inp = ...
        out = opt_model(inp)

.. code-block:: py

    # training
    model = ...
    opt = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

    @torch.compile
    def train(mod, data):
        opt.zero_grad(True)
        pred = mod(data[0])
        loss = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(pred, data[1])
        loss.backward()
        opt.step()

    for _ in range(N_ITERS):
        inp = ...
        train(model, inp)

.. code-block:: py

    # DistributedDataParallel
    model = ...
    opt_model = torch.compile(model)
    model_ddp = DistributedDataParallel(opt_model, ...)

    for _ in range(N_ITERS):
        inp = ...
        out = model_ddp(inp)

``disable`` / ``suppress_errors``
---------------------------------

For some model architectures, there are portions of the model which are particularly difficult to compile
- either there are many graph breaks, or there are crashes. You may want to explicitly disable these
portions of the model which are problematic so that you can apply ``torch.compile`` to the parts that work.
This is done through the ``@torch.compiler.disable`` decorator. When ``torch.compile`` attempts to call a
disabled function, it will graph break and skip tracing the disabled function, resuming tracing after the call.
By default, all recursive calls made from a disabled function are also disabled. Use the ``recursive=False``
option to allow compilation for recursive calls.

.. code-block:: py

    def bad1_inner(...):
        # skipped

    @torch.compiler.disable
    def bad1_outer(...):
        # skipped
        bad1_inner(...)

    def bad2_inner(...)
        # traced

    @torch.compiler.disable(recursive=False)
    def bad2_outer(...):
        # skipped
        bad2_inner(...)

    @torch.compile
    def fn(...):
        # graph break
        bad1_outer(...)
        ...
        # graph break
        bad2_outer(...)

For example, we use ``torch.compiler.disable`` to disable ``torch.compile`` on sparse architecture in
recommendation models, as the sparse arch is difficult to compile. Preprocessing and logging functions
are other examples of functions that typically cause a lot of graph breaks and do not get value from being compiled.

If you are experiencing compiler crashes and you want to YOLO keep going, you can set
``torch._dynamo.config.suppress_errors = True``. Whenever the compiler crashes, we will just skip tracing
the function and try again later. This is not best practice - it is better to eventually manually add
disable annotations as necessary.

Resolving graph breaks
----------------------

Recall that to maximize optimization opportunities, we should reduce the number of graph breaks.
In general, graph breaks are caused by one of:

- You're trying to do something that fundamentally cannot be traced, such as data-dependent control flow.
- You're trying to do something that we haven't gotten around to supporting yet.
  For example, we currently have limited support for tracing code that uses the built-in Python ``inspect`` module.
- Your code has an error in it. For example, you may have tried calling a function with an incorrect number of arguments.

Unfortunately, many graph breaks are not actionable without a deeper understanding of Dynamo.
It can even be difficult to determine which of the 3 causes was the true cause of your graph break.
We are working on making graph break messages more actionable.

If the graph break message doesn't suggest any action and you suspect that the cause of your graph break is (2),
please report the graph break as an issue. If a function has many graph breaks,
consider disabling compilation on that function, the overhead cost for the graph breaks may become prohibitive.

Below are some common graph breaks and some workarounds.

Data-dependent operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``torch.compile`` graph breaks on data-dependent operations such as data-dependent control flow
(if-statements, loops with tensors) and direct tensor data accesses (``.item``, ``.data_ptr``).

.. code-block:: py

    import torch

    @torch.compile
    def fn(x):
        y = x.sum()
        if y > 0:
            return x + y.item()
        return x - y.item()

    fn(torch.ones(3, 3))

::

        if y > 0:

    File "/data/users/williamwen/pytorch/torch/_dynamo/symbolic_convert.py", line 2288, in CALL
        self._call(inst)
    File "/data/users/williamwen/pytorch/torch/_dynamo/symbolic_convert.py", line 2282, in _call
        self.call_function(fn, args, kwargs)
    File "/data/users/williamwen/pytorch/torch/_dynamo/symbolic_convert.py", line 838, in call_function
        self.push(fn.call_function(self, args, kwargs))  # type: ignore[arg-type]
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    File "/data/users/williamwen/pytorch/torch/_dynamo/variables/misc.py", line 1038, in call_function
        return self.obj.call_method(tx, self.name, args, kwargs)
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    File "/data/users/williamwen/pytorch/torch/_dynamo/variables/tensor.py", line 527, in call_method
        result = handler_method(*args, **kwargs)
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    File "/data/users/williamwen/pytorch/torch/_dynamo/variables/tensor.py", line 773, in method_item
        unimplemented("Tensor.item")
    File "/data/users/williamwen/pytorch/torch/_dynamo/exc.py", line 304, in unimplemented
        raise Unsupported(msg, case_name=case_name)
    torch._dynamo.exc.Unsupported: Tensor.item

The general workaround for these graph breaks is to avoid doing data-dependent operations. Some specific workarounds are:

- If your control flow doesn't actually depend on data values, you can change your code to do control flow on constants

.. code-block:: py

    # old
    x = torch.randn(3, 3)
    @torch.compile
    def fn(y):
        if x.sum() > 0:
            return y + x
        else:
            return y - x

    # new
    x = torch.randn(3, 3)
    cond = (x.sum() > 0).item()
    @torch.compile
    def fn(y):
        if cond:
            return y + x
        else:
            return y - x

- Use higher-order ops like ``torch.cond`` (https://pytorch.org/docs/main/cond.html) in place of data-dependent control flow

.. code-block:: py

    # old
    @torch.compile
    def fn(x):
        if x.sum() > 0:
            return x + 1
        return x - 1

    # new
    @torch.compile
    def fn(x):
        return torch.cond(
            x.sum() > 0,
            lambda x: x + 1,
            lambda x: x - 1,
            (x,),
        )

- If you have a ``.item()`` call, try ``torch._dynamo.config.capture_scalar_outputs = True`` or ``TORCHDYNAMO_CAPTURE_SCALAR_OUTPUTS=1``
- Wrap problematic parts of the function in a custom op

Custom ops
^^^^^^^^^^

If you have code that ``torch.compile`` has trouble tracing through, either due to missing support or fundamental incompatibility,
you can consider wrapping the problematic code in a custom op.

Custom ops require a little bit of additional work to get them to be compatible with ``torch.compile``.
See https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/custom_ops_landing_page.html for more details.

Printing
^^^^^^^^

Printing/logging/issuing warnings will result in a graph break. If you have a function that makes many logging calls,
for example, a function that logs data about a training iteration, consider applying ``torch.compiler.disable`` on it.

Alternatively, you can try using ``torch._dynamo.config.reorderable_logging_functions``.
This config is used to reorder logging functions so that they are called at the end of the traced function,
thus avoiding a graph break. However, the logged contents may differ if, for example, a mutation occurs.

.. code-block:: py

    import torch

    torch._dynamo.config.reorderable_logging_functions.add(print)

    @torch.compile
    def fn(x):
        x += 1
        print("log!")
        return torch.sin(x)

    fn(torch.ones(3, 3))

::

    $ TORCH_LOGS="graph_breaks" python playground.py
    log!

Incorrect code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your code may be wrong, or is causing an error. We have limited support for exception handling.

.. code-block:: py

    import torch

    @torch.compile
    def fn(x):
        y = torch.sin(x, x)
        return y

    fn(torch.ones(3, 3))

::

    $ TORCH_LOGS="graph_breaks" python playground.py
    Graph break in user code at /data/users/williamwen/pytorch/playground.py:5
    Reason: Unsupported: TypeError <built-in method sin of type object at 0x7fd6fd764600>: sin() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
    User code traceback:
    File "/data/users/williamwen/pytorch/playground.py", line 5, in fn
        y = torch.sin(x, x)
    ...

Dealing with recompilations
---------------------------

Is dynamic shapes enabled?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Recompilations due to mismatched shapes are in the form:

::

    tensor 'L['x']' size mismatch at index 0. expected 3, actual 4

Make sure that the ``dynamic`` option of ``torch.compile`` is not set to ``False``.
The default option, ``dynamic=None``, will only attempt dynamic shapes after the first compilation.
You can set ``dynamic=True`` to upfront compile as dynamic as possible.

For more information on dynamic shapes, see `The dynamic shapes manual <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GgvOe7C8_NVOMLOCwDaYV1mXXyHMXY7ExoewHqooxrs/edit#heading=h.fh8zzonyw8ng>`__

Changing the cache size limit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a limit to how many times a function can be recompiled, determined by ``torch._dynamo.config.cache_size_limit``.
If this limit is exceeded, then we will not attempt to compile the function again and instead will run the function eagerly.
In the example below, each function call results in a recompile attempt.
When we hit the cache size limit (8), we stop attempting to recompile.

.. code-block:: py

    import torch

    @torch.compile(dynamic=False)
    def fn(x):
        return x + 1

    for i in range(1, 10):
        fn(torch.ones(i))

::

    $ python playground.py
    torch._dynamo hit config.cache_size_limit (8)
        function: 'fn' (/data/users/williamwen/pytorch/playground.py:5)
        last reason: 0/0: tensor 'L['x']' size mismatch at index 0. expected 1, actual 9

If you know that the number of recompilations has a reasonable constant upper bound, you can raise the cache size limit.
If the cost of recompilation outweighs the benefit of compilation, then you can consider lowering the cache size limit.

Wrapping constants with tensors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, ``int`` / ``float`` variables are treated as constants and are guarded as such.
In the below example, we have a recompilation for each function call.

.. code-block:: py

    import torch

    @torch.compile
    def fn(x, c):
        return x + c

    for i in range(1, 10):
        fn(torch.ones(i), 0.5 + i)

Reporting Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the workarounds provided above were not enough to get ``torch.compile`` working,
then you should consider reporting the issue to PyTorch.
But there are a few things that you can do to make our lives significantly easier.

Ablation
--------

Check which component of the ``torch.compile`` stack is the one causing the issue using the ``backend=`` option for ``torch.compile``.
In particular, try:

- ``torch.compile(fn, backend="eager")``, which only runs TorchDynamo, the graph capture component of ``torch.compile``.
- ``torch.compile(fn, backend="aot_eager")``, which runs TorchDynamo and AOTAutograd, which additionally generates the backward graph during compilation.
- ``torch.compile(fn, backend="aot_eager_decomp_partition")``, which runs TorchDynamo and AOTAutograd with operator decompositions/partitions.
- ``torch.compile(fn, backend="inductor")``, which runs TorchDynamo, AOTAutograd, and TorchInductor, the backend ML compiler that generates compiled kernels.

If you only fail with the Inductor backend, you can additionally test various Inductor modes:

- ``torch.compile(fn, backend="inductor", mode="default")``
- ``torch.compile(fn, backend="inductor", mode="reduce-overhead")``
- ``torch.compile(fn, backend="inductor", mode="max-autotune")``

You can also check if dynamic shapes is causing issues with any backend:

- ``torch.compile(fn, dynamic=True)`` (always use dynamic shapes)
- ``torch.compile(fn, dynamic=False)`` (never use dynamic shapes)
- ``torch.compile(fn, dynamic=None)`` (automatic dynamic shapes)

Bisecting
---------
Did you try on the latest nightly? Did something work in the past but now no longer works?
Can you bisect to determine the first nightly where your issue occurs?
Bisecting is especially helpful for performance, accuracy, or compile time regressions,
where it is not immediately obvious where the problem originates from.

Creating a reproducer
---------------------

Creating reproducers is a lot of work, and it is 100% OK if you do not have time to do it.
But if you are a very motivated user who doesn't know very much about the ``torch.compile`` internals,
creating a standalone reproducer can have a huge impact on our ability to fix the bug.
Without a reproducer, your bug report has to have enough information that we can root cause the problem and write a reproducer from scratch.

Here's a list of useful reproducers, with the most preferred first.

1. A self-contained (no external dependencies), small (less than 100 LOC) reproduction script that when run produces the problem.
2. A self-contained but large reproducer. Being self-contained is a huge win!
3. A not self-contained reproducer that is not too sensitive to the dependencies used.
   For example, if you can reproduce a problem if you first ``pip install transformers``
   and then run a script and it will produce the problem, that's not too bad,
   we will probably be able to run it and check things out.
4. A not self-contained reproducer that requires substantial environmental setup / a Docker image to reproduce.
   For example, maybe you need us to download a dataset from some URL, or do multiple nontrivial environment setup steps,
   or the it is very important to have very particular versions of system libraries so a Docker image is required.
   The more difficult it is to setup the environment, the harder it is for us to recreate it and setup the problem.
   NB: Docker makes it "easier" to setup the environment, but it makes it more difficult to change things about the environment
   / use our preferred development environment, so it's not really a magic bullet, although we'll take it in a pinch.

Somewhat orthogonally, a reproducer that can be run in a single process is better than a reproducer
that requires multiprocess training (but once again, if you only have a multiprocess reproducer, we'll take it!).

Additionally, below is a non-exhaustive list of things that you can check for in your
issue that you can attempt to replicate in your reproducer:

- **Autograd**. Did you have tensor inputs with ``requires_grad=True``? Did you call ``backward()`` on the output?
- **Dynamic shapes**. Did you set ``dynamic=True``? Or did you run the test code multiple times with varying shapes?
- **Custom operators**. Is there a custom operator involved in the real workflow?
  Can you replicate some of its important characteristics using the Python custom operator API?
- **Configuration**. Did you set all the same configuration?
  This includes ``torch._dynamo.config`` and ``torch._inductor.config`` settings,
  as well as arguments to ``torch.compile`` like ``backend`` / ``mode``.
- **Context managers**. Did you replicate any active context managers?
  This could be ``torch.no_grad``, automatic mixed precision, ``TorchFunctionMode`` / ``TorchDispatchMode``,
  activation checkpointing, compiled autograd etc.
- **Tensor subclasses**. Is there a tensor subclass involved?

Minifier
--------

The minifier is an early ``torch.compile`` tool that, given an FX graph that crashes when we attempt to run or compile it,
finds a subgraph that also crashes and outputs the code that performs that subgraph's operations.
Essentially, the minifier finds a minimal repro for a certain class of ``torch.compile``-related crashes.
Note that this assumes that we were able to successfully trace through code.

Unfortunately, most of the time nowadays, the minifier doesn't work and you'll have to do something else
(we like to think that this is because bugs that can have repros automatically generated this way are all easy to fix,
so we've fixed them all, and that leaves the hard bugs that don't repro easily).
But it's very easy to try, so you might as well try it and cry when it doesn't work.

Instructions for operating the minifier can be found `here <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.compiler_troubleshooting_old.html>`__.
If the compiler is crashing, you can set ``TORCHDYNAMO_REPRO_AFTER="dynamo"`` or ``TORCHDYNAMO_REPRO_AFTER="aot"``
(``aot`` is more likely to work, but it won't catch AOTAutograd bugs) and then pray that the generated ``repro.py`` actually has your problem.
If it's an accuracy problem, you can try ``TORCHDYNAMO_REPRO_LEVEL=4`` (and cry when it fails to find the actual subgraph that has a problem).

Debugging Deeper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section details tools and techniques if you want to try to debug ``torch.compile`` issues on your own
or if you want to learn more about the ``torch.compile`` stack.
These methods are more involved than those presented above and are used by PyTorch developers regularly
to debug real ``torch.compile`` issues.

Below is a high level view of the stack:

.. image:: _static/img/dynamo/td_stack.png

There are three main components to this stack; TorchDynamo, AOTAutograd, and Inductor.
Our debugging strategy will first focus on narrowing down the component in which the error is occurring
and then individually debugging the component. For identifying the component where your issue is originating,
first see the `Ablation` section above under `Reporting Issues` above. To debug an individual component, see the sections below.

TorchDynamo
-----------

Logging what Dynamo is tracing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``TORCH_LOGS=trace_bytecode`` option enables you to see the exact bytecode instructions that Dynamo is tracing through,
as well as a symbolic representation of the Python interpreter stack. When encountering a graph break or crash,
it is generally good to inspect the last few bytecode instructions traced.

You can also use ``TORCH_LOGS=trace_source`` to see which lines of source code Dynamo is tracing through.
This is useful in combination with ``trace_bytecode`` to see the line of source code each traced bytecode instruction corresponds to.

Finally, you can use ``TORCH_LOGS=graph_code`` to see the Python code representing the FX graph that Dynamo traced.
You can view this code to double check that the correct ops are being traced.

.. code-block:: py

    import torch

    def g(x, y):
        return x + y

    @torch.compile(backend="eager")
    def f(x):

            return (x_1,)

Breakpointing Dynamo tracing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inserting a breakpoint in Dynamo/user code is helpful at times to see what the state of Dynamo is when tracing through user code.
Unfortunately, inserting a breakpoint in the normal python fashion will result in a graph break in TorchDynamo,
so we will not be able to view the state of Dynamo at the point where we intended to breakpoint.

The first way to breakpoint is to insert a breakpoint in the Dynamo source. 3 good places to place a breakpoint are:

- In ``torch/_dynamo/symbolic_convert.py``, breakpoint at functions that are named after the problematic bytecode instruction
  (e.g. ``def CALL_FUNCTION``, ``def STORE_ATTR``). You can conditionally breakpoint depending on inputs
  (e.g. the argval of the instruction, or the name of the object at the top of the stack) since some bytecode opcodes are frequently used.
- Breakpoint where the graph break or error originates from. Typically, graph breaks are emitted from a call to ``unimplemented(...)``.
- Breakpoint in ``torch/_dynamo/variables/builder.py, function:_wrap``. You will likely have to conditionally breakpoint on the input.
  This function determines how to symbolically represent a given value. Consider breakpointing here if you suspect that a value is represented incorrectly.

The second way to breakpoint is to use ``torch._dynamo.comptime.comptime.breakpoint``:

.. code-block:: py

    from torch._dynamo.comptime import comptime

    @torch.compile
    def f(...):
        ...
        comptime.breakpoint()
        ...

A comptime breakpoint is convenient because it will allow you to inspect the Dynamo state at a given location in the user code being traced.
It does not require you to breakpoint in the Dynamo source nor conditionally breakpoint based on variables.

When a comptime breakpoint is triggered, you can do the following:

- ``ctx.print_bt()`` to print the user stack trace
- ``ctx.print_locals()`` to print all current locals
- ``ctx.print_graph()`` to print the currently traced graph
- ``ctx.disas()`` to print the currently traced function's bytecode
- Normal pdb commands like ``bt/u/d/n/s/r`` - you can go up the pdb stack to inspect more Dynamo internals

.. code-block:: py

    import torch
    from torch._dynamo.comptime import comptime

    @torch.compile(backend="eager")
    def f(x):
        y = x + 1
        comptime.breakpoint()
        y = y + 1
        return y

    f(torch.ones(3, 3))

::

    $ python playground.py
    --Return--
    > /data/users/williamwen/pytorch/torch/_dynamo/comptime.py(392)inner()->None
    -> builtins.breakpoint()
    (Pdb) ctx.print_bt()
    File "/data/users/williamwen/pytorch/playground.py", line 7, in f
        comptime.breakpoint()

    (Pdb) ctx.print_locals()
    x = FakeTensor(..., size=(3, 3))
    y = FakeTensor(..., size=(3, 3))
    (Pdb) bt

    > /data/users/williamwen/pytorch/torch/_dynamo/comptime.py(392)inner()->None

    def forward(self, L_x_: "f32[3, 3]"):
        l_x_ = L_x_

        # File: /data/users/williamwen/pytorch/playground.py:6 in f, code: y = x + 1
        y: "f32[3, 3]" = l_x_ + 1;  l_x_ = y = None

..
    TODO(uncomment/update once we improve this API)
    Debugging large models
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Debugging TorchDynamo on large models can be tricky, mainly because Dynamo traces through large amounts of code.
    It can be difficult to find the problematic function, or to determine where to place a breakpoint.
    Even if we've found the problematic function, we don't want to deal with logging spam.
    Fortunately, you can use ``TORCHDYNAMO_DEBUG_FUNCTION=<function name>``, which limits dynamo tracing to only functions with a specific name
    (exact match). This will allow you to filter all of the functions in the model to the function(s) of interest.
    Use this in combination with the above debugging strategies.

Bytecode generation errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible (though not common) for Dynamo to generate incorrect bytecode. This might be the case if you determine:

- Ablation reveals the error is happening at the TorchDynamo level
- The error is not being emitted from TorchDynamo stack frames
- The error looks more like a user error rather than a Dynamo error, or is a segfault
- The error does not occur without ``torch.compile``

Bytecode generation bugs are generally tricky to fix and we recommend just submitting an issue.
If you are interested in seeing the bytecode that Dynamo generates, you can use ``TORCH_LOGS=bytecode``.
You can see a high-level overview on what bytecode Dynamo generates `here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tMZOoAoNKF32CAm1C-WfzdVVgoEvJ3lp/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114922067987692817315&rtpof=true&sd=true>`__.

AOTAutograd
-----------

AOTAutograd errors are typically difficult to debug - we recommend just submitting an issue.
AOTAutograd logging output is primarily helpful to see what the input to Inductor is.
